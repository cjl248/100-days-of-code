# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on figuring out how to scroll to the top of a component when a user clicks on it.

**Thoughts:** Took me a long time to get refs working and learned that you can't use them on functional components. It was new for me and I feel good about learning more about how React works.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
